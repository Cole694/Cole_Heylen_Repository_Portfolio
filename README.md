# [Project 1: TitanicAnalysis Project Overview](https://github.com/Cole694/TitanicAnalysis)
- In this project the Titanic dataset is analysed and prepared for ML fitting.
- A classifiction algorithm is used to predict wheter a passenger whould have survived the wreck or not.
- The data is analysed and visualised to show various relations between the features in the data.
- The data was sourced from kaggle.com

# [Project 2: OlympicsExploration Project Overview](https://github.com/Cole694/OlympicsExploration)
- In this project the Olympic games between 1976 and 2008 are analysed.
- The data is preprocessed and engeneered for alalysing.
- The data is visualised displaying specific relations between features.
- The data was sourced on kaggle.com

# [Project 3: CarSalesPrediction Project Overview](https://github.com/Cole694/CarSalesPrediction)
- Created a regression model that was able to predict car sale prices accurately.
- The data used in this project was sourced from kaggle.com
- The data is preprocessed and analysed in Section 1.
- In Section 2 the data is cleaned.
- Section 3 consists of model selection, training and implementation.
